# CompositionalData
Analysis of unbalanced and irregular compositional data
Issue: Data are unbalanced and irregular, thus, the number of equations to be estimated simultaneously is not constant across observations. 
Comparison of several analytical approaches: seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) on subsamples, meta-analysis of separate SUR analyses, generalized estimating equations on full dataset. 
Project scope: Data for 28 countries since 1945.
